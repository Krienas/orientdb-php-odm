## Current status of the binding

BETA: the binding is almost finished, we will develop a custom mapper which will sit on top of this low-level binding.
Some things will change (implementation of better interfaces, naming conventions), but nothing should stop you from using it (yes, also in production: further changes in the binding will be small and well-documented).

## Current status of the mapper

Just started. Things will come.
